type(bytes)

Note: You probably don't need to worry about bytes until
      you get a bit more advanced.

bytes are like strings, but each individual 'character' is
only 8 bits wide. So it can't do unicode characters

You can define bytes in a similar way to strings,
but just need a b at the start

>>> b'ABC'
b'ABC'

>>> type(b'ABC')
<class 'bytes'>
